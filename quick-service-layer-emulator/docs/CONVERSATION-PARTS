CONVERSATION-PARTS
==========
Loaded with a conversation file.

Initially a conversation part will contain nothing but a piece of a
conversation between a client and a server.

However, it is planned that conversation parts may contain EL expressions that
dynamically fill in certain aspects of a conversation.
