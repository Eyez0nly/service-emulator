In order to support user registration, bundles need to support bundle loaders. The loader can be specified
and contained in the bundle file. If a bundle contains a loader, it must contain a certificate. If it
does not, the bundle will not load. If the user declines the certificate, the bundle will not load.

Once control is passed to the bundle loader, the bundle specification does not really matter -- just as
long as all of the required elements are delivered to the client in some way.
