Need registry.properties to map service type to service class and options page name.
Need settings folder
- Contains config.properties
- Contains registry.properties
Need to shift gears on options page. Will implement one options page per service type. Expand in each case to
	include new functionality (e.g. hosts or routes or local-only; if hosts, which DNS server to use)
Need to implement limited scripting. Script files will point to: config.properties to use, any external programs
	that need to run, which services need to run, the location of any relevant replay bundles. Will have
	allowances for managing the order and timing of service starts and external program starts.
Need to implement recording of traffic for repeater.
Need to implement bundling of replay files.
Need to implement encrypting/decrypting of replay bundles.
Need to implement route/hosts checking on service start to ensure that the requested route/host is present.
Implement creating keystore and truststore in app
on run, create keystore if one does not exist.
add config entry for keystore file location.
add config entry for truststore file location.
if ssl is required for a service, implement verifying the truststore.
Implement if using hosts, bypassing the hosts file for passthrough connection
Implement list of services instead of static services (two types: repeater and passthrough)

Create redistributable mvn task
- creates redistributable that contains:
	* obfuscated main jar
	* external library jars
	* .bat file for invokation of app

Verify code obfuscation

Tokenize the path separator in the default config file. Poor man uses MessageFormat.
