CONVERSATION-FILES
==========
Loaded with bundles or separately.

Conversation files are used with repeater services only.

They represent the conversation that will take place between the client and the
server. A conversation element starts with:

0000:client.filename:NNN

Where 0000 represents 0 seconds on the conversation timeline.

client tells us that this communication is sent by the client.

filename is the name of the file that contains the contents of the
communication.

NNN is how many bytes this communication is expected to be.

Following the first line, the time field will represent a number of
milliseconds from the first communication.

Additionally, a client communication will not make use of the contents of the
referenced file. The name of the file is merely included for a user's
reference.

A server line looks like this:

0100:server.filename:134

In the case of a server communication, the file contents do matter as whatever
is contained inthe file will be what is sent to the client.
