ENCRYPTED BUNDLE
==========
May be loaded from the commandline or at runtime
==========

An encrypted bundle is identical in structure to a non-encrypted bundle. The
only difference is that the encrypted bundle file is... well... encrypted.
Additionally, the user must know that the bundle is encrypted. At the command
line, the user will specify the -e flag. And in order for an encrypted bundle
to be loaded from the UI, the user must select the "Open Encrypted Bundle" menu
option.

Initially, only one encryption method will be supported.
