SCRIPT
==========
Loaded from a bundle
==========

Every line of a script file specified either an external program to run or a
defined service to run. Each line should contain a new directive.

Services are specified by name. (e.g. exampleRepeater)

External programs are specified with the string "ep" followed by the command
and any commandline arguments. The command may be absolute, relative, or
dynamic. A dynamic command is demarcated like this: ${EXAMPLE_COMMAND}. The
value of ${EXAMPLE_COMMAND} will be sought in the config.properties. If it is
not present, none of the script will be run.

However, if a bundle containing dynamic commands is detected, before its script
is run, the UI will prompt the user to fill in any missing dynamic command
variables.

Finally, if an external command requires permissions escalation, precede the
command with "eep" instead of "ep".

Examples:
--------

Start a service:

exampleServiceName

Execute an external command using an absolute path:

ep C:\Windows\Notepad.exe somefile.txt

Execute an external command using a dynamic variable:

ep ${MailServer} smtp.host.com 25

Execute a command that requires escalation:

eep regedit.exe somefile.reg
