-b <bundle file name>
	Loads the specified bundle at startup. If the bundle is not found or if
	there is an error loading the bundle, the application exits.
	
-e
	Only used with -b. The specified bundle is encrypted. If -k is not present,
	the user will be prompted to enter the key from the commandline.
	
-k <encryption key>
	Only used with -e. Specified the encryption key that will be used to
	decrypt the encrypted bundle.
	
-p <true|false>
	Sets "Prompt for Each Script Element" in the options menu to the given.
	value. While true, when starting a service bundle, the user will be
	prompted to approve the execution of each element in the loaded bundle's
	script. Note that this option has no effect on external programs that ask
	for escalation. The behavior of those script elements is set separately.
