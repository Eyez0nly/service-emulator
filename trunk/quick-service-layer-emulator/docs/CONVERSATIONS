CONVERSATIONS

May be loaded from the commandline (via a bundle) or at runtime

Conversations come in two styles: self-contained archives and exploded. Both
styles share similar characteristics, but they will each be described
separately.

Self-contained Archives
----------

The file name of the archive (the file extension is ignored) corresponds with
the conversationNames property.

The archive contains a conversation file (see CONVERSATION-FILES) in the root
named "conversation". Additionally, the root contains the individual
conversation components (see CONVERSATION-PARTS) referenced by the conversation
file.

Exploded Conversations
----------

These conversations are not contained in archives, and as the name suggests,
the individual components of the conversation could be scattered throughout the
filesystem.

An exploded conversation begins with a reference to a conversation file. The
name of the conversation file corresponds with the conversationNames property.

In this type of conversation file, the references to the conversation
components may be either relative OR absolute OR some combination of each.
Subsequently, the conversation file need not restrict itself to referencing
components that exist in just the directory in which the conversation file
resides.
