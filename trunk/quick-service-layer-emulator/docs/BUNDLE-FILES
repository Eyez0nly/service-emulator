BUNDLE FILES
==========
May be loaded from the commandline or at runtime
==========

Bundle files are zip files containing the elements necessary to instruct the
application how to emulate a service or services.

The root of the bundle contains the config.properties for the bundle (see
CONFIG.PROPERTIES for details) that defines the services that will be activated
when the user "Starts" the bundle.

The root also contains a SCRIPT file (see SCRIPT for details) that contians
instructions about the order in which services and any external programs will
be started.

The root may also contain a bundleLoader.properties (see
BUNDLELOADER.PROPERTIES) file that contains information on which BundleLoader
to use. Specified bundles that are not amongst the defaults registered in the
registry.properties file must extend ExternalBundleLoader. Additionally, the
root of the bundle must also contain an identifying certificate.

If repeaters are used, the root should also contain a conversation file for
each of the conversations (see CONVERSATIONS) that need to be repeated by the
configured repeaters. There is a correspondence between the names of the
conversation files and the conversationNames property used in
config.properties.

Bundle files may be encrypted (see ENCRYPTED-BUNDLE). If the file is encrypted,
have your key ready when you load the bundle.
